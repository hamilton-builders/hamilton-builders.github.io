    I was fortunate to learn this business from childhood by working for my father, Frank Hamilton, a highly respected homebuilder of Longview. Since forming my own company in 1990, I have been further blessed by success in work that I love and that enhances my home town. I hold the Graduate Master Builder designation from the National Association of Homebuilders, and my employees and associates are similarly qualified in their respective fields. To stay abreast of current methods, materials, and styles, we regularly attend professional seminars and trade shows.
